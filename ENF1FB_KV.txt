A Prayer to the Root and Lineage Masters and the Assembly of the Yidam, Ḍākinīs, and Dharma Protectors of the Sakya Lineage Gentle protectors, the root and lineage Sakya masters, Glorious Hevajra, the most central yidam deity, And the assembly of ḍākinīs, dharma protectors, and wealth deities, With devotion I pray to you-look upon me with eyes of wisdom! May I and all those sentient beings who are connected with me Live long, be free of illness, increase in realization and experience in this life, And take rebirth in the pure land of Great Bliss in the next. Bless us so that we can guide all beings of the three realms. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo composed this prayer.
